2.	Boil or steam the broccoli for about 7 minutes, until bright green and just tender.
3.	Heat the olive oil in a saucepan on a low heat and then add the garlic. Stir fry for about 30 seconds, being careful not to let the garlic brown, then add the puy lentils. Stir gently for 4-5 minutes to warm through.
4.	Season to taste with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Then add most of the dill and stir through.
5.	Place the steamed broccoli onto a plate, and dress with the extra virgin olive oil, the remaining lemon juice, and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Tip the warm puy lentils over, dollop the crème fraiche on top, and then scatter with the hazelnuts and remaining dill. Serve immediately.

Don’t just save the barbecue for burgers and sausages – this exceptionally flavoursome recipe is a brilliant (barbecued) starter or side dish. You could even serve it as a main dish for vegetarians.", "1.	Toss the  broccoli in the 1 tbsp of olive oil and keep to one side while you make the dressing. Finely chop the sun-dried tomatoes and place in a small bowl with the extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.
2.	Place the Tenderstem® broccoli on your barbecue and cook for about 5-8 minutes, turning regularly until it is becoming tender with grill lines on the stems.
3.	Place the barbecued  broccoli on a serving plate and immediately crumble over the goat’s cheese so it starts to melt just slightly from the heat of the  broccoli.
4.	Spoon over the dressing, scatter with the pine nuts and serve straight away.

Snip the ends off the fig stalks. This makes them easier to cut through. Cut a cross through the stalk down to nearly the base of the fig taking care not to completely cut it into quarters
2.	Cut the mozzarella into 4 and place a piece inside each fig. Wrap each fig with a slice of Parma ham and then skewer two figs onto each skewer ensuring you pierce the fig flesh, the cheese and the fig flesh on the other side. You don't want them to be loose on the skewers.
3.	Place them under a medium grill for 5-10 minutes until the cheese is starting to turn golden
4.	Meanwhile heat your butter and garlic in a wok or frying pan on a medium heat and add your Tenderstem® broccoli. Toss the broccoli often so that it's covered in the garlic butter and put a lid over it
5.	Use this time to grate your orange zest
6.	After 5 minutes, toss again, season well and plate up. Sprinkle your zest over everything and give the figs a little black pepper
